# Img Generation 

This folder is dedicated to all the images I generated for this RPC.
There's code here because I did not want to hand-create all the images for every damn key on the keyboard I can press. So as a result I used Pillow (The Python Image Library) to help streamline
the creation of all the images. I also used a custom font saved in the repo as well. 

I believe that imggen.py should be runnable and will mostlikely work as long as the files are prepared correctly. You can customize the font and how it all generates by changing
the code. This file was hard-coded as it wasn't meant to be a full-on program, but more or less an assisting tool to be used once.
